One hot summer day, Petya and his friend Vasya decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and ripest one, in their opinion. After a short weighing procedure, the scales 
they showed <i>w</i> kilogram. Hurriedly running home, exhausted from thirst, the guys began to share the purchased berry, but they faced a difficult task. Petya and Vasya 
they are big fans of even numbers, so they want to divide the watermelon so that each share weighs exactly an even number of kilograms, while it is not necessary that 
the shares were equal in size. The guys are very tired and want to start eating as soon as possible, so you should tell them if it will be possible to divide the watermelon, taking into account their
wishes. Of course, everyone should get a piece of positive weight.

## Input
The first and only line of the input data contains an integer <i>w</i> (1 ≤ <i>w</i> ≤ 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the guys.

## Output
Print YES if the guys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of which weighs an even number of kilograms, and NO otherwise.

## Examples
| Input | Output |
|:------|:-------|

## Note
For example, the guys can divide a watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilograms, respectively (another option is two parts of 4 and 4 kilograms).
