# 4. Knight's move
A rectangular board is given *N*×*M* (*N* rows and *M* columns). In the upper left corner there is a chess knight, which must be moved to the 
lower right corner of the board. In this task, the knight can move two squares down and one square to the right or one square down and two 
squares to the right.  

It is necessary to determine how many different routes there are leading from the upper left to the lower right corner.

## Input format
The input file contains two natural numbers *N* and *M* (1 ≤ *N*, *M* ≤ 50).

## Output format
In the output file, print a single number — the number of ways to get the knight to the lower right corner of the board.
